          After creating the website, submit it to an automated WCAG testing platform (e.g.: AChecker). Based on the feedback you get, create a second version of the site fixing all the detected problems. Finally, write a short report (approx. 500 words) of the preparations you did beforehand to ensure universal accessibility and which users/ needs/ situations you had in mind; and the changes you made between the first and second page. The report must be included as an HTML page as part of the website.

<p><strong> Things done to ensure universal accessibility and different user/needs/situations though of</strong>

<p>To ensure accessability, sematics tags (i.e "footer" and "article") were used. In addtion, steps were taken to make the page look good when zooming (SOMEONE WRITE WHAT WAS DONE!). We made sure the navigation bar was easy to navigate with from all pages, and accessible using only keyboard. 
To make the text easy to read, we tried to use easy words and short and easy top understand sentences. The hemingway app (https://hemingwayapp.com/) was used for the about us page as an additional step to ensure  good readability. </p>

<p> We wanted a clean frontpage, showing only the most important information (address, resturant name, opening hours). The grey blur window was added to make the text readable even with the pancake picture having rather strong colors.  </p>
<p> Using this code @media screen, we made sure the pages work for mobile and other small devices. Example: @media screen and (min-width: 318px) and (max-width: 374px). For both the about us and contact page, this make elements appear above each other instead of by the side of each other.</p>
<p> To make the page easy to find using google, we added the description meta tag with a short description for the resturant. We also added the title tag.</p>

<p><strong>Index.html (home-page) validation:</strong>
  W3S-validator check results gave 3 errors; the first one was about “Consider avoiding viewport values that prevent users from resizing documents.” This is fixed by removing the user-scalable value which was set to “no”. 
  Second issue was “Element p not allowed as child of element h2 in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)”. This one is fixed by having the p element before h2. The last issue was about the “menu” button on index.html: 
  The element button must not appear as a descendant of p element.”. This one is also fixed by changing the places of a (link) and button elements so that button element would not appear as child of a element. In order to make the index page more user friendly, different region identifiers and labels used such as nav label, and region names; main and footer.

<p><strong>About page validation:</strong>
The accessability checker showed no know problems for the about page.  </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Contact page validation:</strong>
  This page uses semantic tags to separate content and increase accessability - such as "main", "section" and "nav" - so that it is optimized for SEO/crawlable and accessable for those with visual impairments or users without mouse access. CSS & HTML comments are also included to increase the readibility of the code.
   
</p>
<p>
  The website had to be responsive for all devices, therefore we used @mediascreen CSS thouroughly in all the pages.
  The only problem discovered by the accessability checker for this page was that the img tag (pancake-logo.png) lacked an alt attribute. This is fixed in the final version.
