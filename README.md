## Sections: 

## 1. Overview
For this assignment, we have chosen the option __b__: Website for a restaurant / cafe. The name of the cafe is __Pancake House__, and makes the best pancakes in the world! 

Our webpage is consist of four pages: Home, Menu, About and Contact. We have also included the report.html in the navigation bar in order to make it more accessable and to meet the oblig-criterias. 


## 2. Key elements
We wanted to create a simple but powerful and beautiful website with minimalistic design. We have challenged ourselves to implement some advanced css-styles and effects as seen on the index.html where the "backdrop-filter: blur" code is used to make the text more readable. 

We have also worked on diffreent elements and tried to make the site user friendly and accassable. For this purpose, we tried to provide clear, engaging, and easy-to-find content on our site.
